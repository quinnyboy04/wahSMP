<h2>Player Trading</h2>
<h4>You can safely trade with the Trade plugin. It's simple. You can offer things, and the other person in the trade can also offer things. When you think the trade is okay, you press the green wool, but if you don't think the trade is okay, you press the red button. When both players are happy with the trade, and both have pressed the green button, the items will automatically switch from the inventories.</h4>
